I received both my bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the Department of Informatics at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2018 and 2020, respectively. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at Harokopio University of Athens and working as a Research Associate with the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece. My research interests include AI fairness, face recognition, AI at the edge, computer vision, and deep learning. To date, I have authored 18 publications, including 9 first-author conference papers and 2 first-author journal articles, with two of the first-authored works published in top-tier venues, i.e., IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) and IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI).
